### IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW FILES ARE ORGANIZED

Results of various simulation studies for analyzing the performance of my isomiR count denoising algorithm are stored in the sims directory. In the sims directory is a subdirectory labeled with the date that the simulations were run. For example, the folder contains results of denoising simulated length variant count data that were run on January 8th, 2025. The convention for writing the date for the folder name is MM_DD_YYYY. The date folder then contains two more folders: `partition_objs` and `results`.
